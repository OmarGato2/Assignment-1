                    His mom, Ikram, originally was planning for him to go to BC Muslim School, but he had a panic
                    attack. So
                    instead, he took Mitchell Elementary School and enjoyed the subjects, field trips, friendships and
                    other events that were memorable to him. He has gotten to know his friends, who he went to a similar
                    high school. He still keeps in touch with them afterwards.
                    He spended 8 years at Mitchell Elementary School and received a certificate at the Grad Assembly of
                    2015
                    since 2007.

                    In September 2015, he then started attending Cambie Secondary School at the age of 12 and lasted 5
                    years until his
                    graduation. 2 years ago, he has hoped to walk across the stage at the UBC Chan Centre, but
                    unfortunately
                    due to COVID, he couldn't perform his wishes there, so he walked across the steps toward the
                    principal and shook hands while
                    getting his picture taken. He was struggling to turn the tassel to the side room with the
                    setup which was funny. He finally left outside on a beautiful sunny weather, throw the grad cap in
                    the
                    air with excitement, and went out with $1250 scholarship Physical and Heath Education and $200
                    scholarship for Office. <sup>[2]</sup>

                    In September 2020, he started 1 year and 4 months at Langara College to study for Associate of Arts
                    Degree in Social Sciences. He dropped 2 courses from Fall 2020 becasue he felt the pressure once he
                    either didn't do well in the midterm or how hard the courses were to him. He took a total of 7
                    courses from 2 years ago to last year in the fall, in order for him to register while transfering to
                    BCIT.

                    work period which involves individual project instead of group project, instructor prints out
                    lecture notes, taking a break while in the class and go for a walk, and extra time in quizzes,
                    midterms, and exams.
